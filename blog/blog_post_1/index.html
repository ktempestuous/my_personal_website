          <h3>Motivation</h3>

          <p>
            Last year I put together a personal website using a beautiful template I found online. It looked great:
            sleek animations, big images, lots of polish. I was happy with it—until I started thinking about what it
            <em>costs</em> to run a website.
          </p>

          <p>
            I attended the GreenIO conference in Munich and learned about website sustainability for the first time.
            I’d never really considered that websites can be surprisingly carbon intensive—especially when they ship
            lots of JavaScript, heavy fonts, huge images, or rely on multiple third-party services.
          </p>

          <p>
            After that, I went looking for “sustainable” website templates. I didn’t find much that felt both simple
            and genuinely lightweight. There are excellent sustainable web developers out there, but for a small
            personal site, hiring someone wasn’t realistic for me.
          </p>

          <p>
            So I decided to build what I couldn’t find: a lightweight, sustainable personal website template that I
            could use myself—and that others could reuse too.
          </p>

          <h3>What I aimed for</h3>

          <p>
            The goal wasn’t to chase perfection. It was to make something that is:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>small and fast to load</li>
            <li>easy to understand and edit</li>
            <li>free to host (I’m using GitHub Pages)</li>
            <li>low on unnecessary dependencies</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            I used sustainability guidelines as my compass and leaned on ChatGPT to help write and refactor parts of
            the code. Yes, using AI has its own footprint—but my hope is that creating one reusable, lightweight
            template reduces the need for lots of people (including me) to reinvent the wheel with bulky, carbon-heavy
            templates.
          </p>

          <p>
            The idea is that this template should be self-explanatory and simple to customise: change the text, add a
            post, tweak the colours, and you’re done.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>If you use it</h3>

          <p>
            If you end up using the template, I’d genuinely love to hear about it. What did you build? What worked
            well? What was confusing?
          </p>

          <p>
            And if you have ideas for improvements—whether it’s accessibility, performance, structure, or just nicer
            defaults—please tell me. I’d like this to stay lightweight, but also friendly to use and easy to maintain.
